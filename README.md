# Getting Started with this Projet

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

## Objective of this task

  1. Improve codebase to follow standard react practice.

 # Hint :
     
     1. Make seperate components.
     2. Try to reuse the components.

  2. There are bugs in the codebase that you have to solve.
   
   ## Bug Example : 

   # 1. Modifying the state directly 

```
const [name,setName] = useState("");

useEffect(()=>{
 name = 'Sam'
},[])

```


   # 2. Using class insted of className

```
<div class="userList">...</div>

```
